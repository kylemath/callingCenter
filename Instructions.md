Election Day Callers!

Thank you all very much for helping the campaign team on Election Day. This is the culmination of all our hard work, and your efforts today will be the last opportunity to get supporters out to the polls, and we greatly appreciate you helping us! 
You'll be calling identified supporters. There's a script below that you're welcome to shape into your own voice. Your main goals are to:

Remind them that today is Election Day.
Confirm whether they’ve voted yet.
Share that polls are open until 8:00 p.m.
Help them find their polling station  edmonton.ca/election
Offer a ride if they need one — just text, email, or call the campaign team, and we'll arrange it.
I would suggest turning off your phone's caller id (iPhone) (android) and having your computer already on the edmonton.ca/election page so that you're ready to enter addresses. 

You can start making your calls at 10AM, and continue through the day until about 7pm. You do not need to leave voicemail messages. If you finish your list, you can go through it again, and again, annnd again, going through the numbers that did not pick up. Our job is to be politely persistent, reminding everyone to get out to vote. 

There are two attachments, one a zip file with numbered files, and another pdf that identifies the file we have assigned to you. You will need to enter your email address as the password to access the file. If you run into any issues opening it, please reach out to the campaign team right away, we'll get it sorted quickly.

When all your volunteer duties are over, you are all invited to the campaign headquarters to watch the results come in. 

With much gratitude, 
Campaign Team

Here is the script that I think will help you with navigating the calls: 

"Hello, my name is _______________, and I'm a volunteer with the campaign. I understand our team has had the chance to connect with you during the campaign, so I'm following up to make sure you know it's Election Day!

Have you had a chance to vote yet?”

(If Yes)

"That's fantastic! Thank you so much for taking the time to vote! Every vote makes a difference today."

(If No)

“No problem, there’s still plenty of time, polls are open until 8pm. Do you know where your polling station is?”

(If they’re unsure)

“No worries, I can help you find it.” [Ask for the address if it’s not listed and enter it at edmonton.ca/election.]
https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/for-voters

“Do you need a ride or any help getting to your polling station today? We have volunteers available to assist.”

"This election is one of the most important in shaping Edmonton's future. Our candidate is focused on building a more connected, affordable, and forward-thinking city, and ready to work collaboratively but firmly with the province on the big issues that matter."

“We just need every supporter to get out and vote today. Can we count on you to make it to the polls before they close?”

(If yes)

"That's great to hear, thank you so much! Every vote really matters today. Have a great rest of your day, and thank you for helping elect our candidate!"

(If uncertain)

"Totally understand, even a few minutes today can make a real difference. Our candidate is counting on community-minded Edmontonians like you to help keep our city moving forward. If there's anything we can do to make voting easier, please let us know."
